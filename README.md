## Setup

Setup to this project should be fairly straightforward.

Reminder that you'll need to run the backend simultaneously.

Start by installing packages:

### `npm i`

After that finishes installing:

### `npm start`

That's it.. see, told you it was straightforward. 

I also have one very sad unit test in her, you can watch the magic in action by running:

### `npm test`
